# Problems of DoE
Design of Experiments | ECNU 24 Fall
***
This repository contains proofs and solutions of problems of the eighth edition of ‘Design and Analysis of Experiments’ by Douglas C.Montgomery (2013).

It is a story about statistics, experiments and tests. It's told by Prof. Zhou and marked down by me. Python is chosen to be the tool for modeling and noting.

Anyway, happy hunting.
